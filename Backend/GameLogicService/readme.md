# Game Logic Service

Runs game code in server in a deterministic fashion.

For more information please refer to our confluence:

# How to Run:

You will only want to run this in case of very specific debugging.

Usually for gameplay debugging please refer to StandaloneServer to simulate
playfab cloudscript and connect to the game in a seamless way.

If you want to run only the logic service, please ensure:

- You have Docker installed
- You have Docker running

Then just click "Play". The IDE will build and run the image,
and a swagger UI to check the server endpoint will appear on your
browser.
